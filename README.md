## :no_entry_sign: Standard Compliant

[![js-standard-style](https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/feross/standard)
This project adheres to Standard.  Our CI enforces this, so we suggest you enable linting to keep your project compliant during development.


This project uses [react-native-config](https://github.com/luggit/react-native-config) to expose config variables to your javascript code in React Native. You can store API keys
and other sensitive information in a `.env` file:

```
API_URL=https://myapi.com
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=abcdefgh
```

and access them from React Native like so:

```
import Secrets from 'react-native-config'

Secrets.API_URL  // 'https://myapi.com'
Secrets.GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY  // 'abcdefgh'
```

The `.env` file is ignored by git keeping those secrets out of your repo.
